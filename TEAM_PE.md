# Team Policies and Expectations

## Instructor's Expectations and Responsabilities for All Students

### Project Iteration Responsibilities of the Team (as a Team)
* Together, determine the distribution of work and design this distribution so that it is possible for each team member to contribute a roughly equal effort toward the success of the project. Make your best guess about this at the start of the project, and refine the responsibilities if needed as you go. Consult the instructor if any issues arise or you need clarifications.

#### Distribution of Work
**Step 1: Please, provide here a brief description (one short paragraph) of the distribution of work across your team. You can refine this description as you carry out the project iteration.**

### Project Responsibilities of the Individual
* Individually, contribute to the success of the team according to the policies and schedule agreed upon by all team members. Individually, create the opportunity for everyone in your group to succeed at being a good team member - don't do all the work yourself.

Detailed Description:

+ It can be seen in commits and branches.

## Additional Expectations and Responsabilities Set by The Students
Establish your own additional team policies around the following aspects:

* Expectations for regular group meetings and synchronous class/lab attendance.
* Expectations for frequency, method, and response time for communication on Piazza.
* Expectations for using other forms of electronic communication.
* Expectations for frequency of contributions to the project.
* Expectations on how to communicate when things are not working as we expected.
* Others.

#### Additional Expectations and Responsabilities
**Step 2: Please, describe here (using as much text as you need) additional expections and responsabilities for this project iteration**.

+ Hope we can meet in-person.

+ Use good variable names and good comments. (**That's important**)

+ Please use 2 for `Tab size`, 2 for `Indent` and 4 for `Continuation` as shown in lab4. (I know that the whole point of indentation is to clearly define where a control block starts and ends. Especially when you stare at your screen for 20 hours, you will find that a larger indentation will make it easier for you to distinguish the indentation. But since the indentation format of the given code is like this, we don't need to modify it again.)

+ The length of each row is limited to 100 columns, and we strongly recommend that you follow this convention.

+ If you have messed up, feel free to contract other members. It is expected that all members are reachable during the weekdays to answer others' questions about the group work or tasks.

+ Please put the new code in new branch when you want to add a feature, like if you are working in task7, make a branch called task7 and put your code in this branch. **Do not just push to the main branch except for Team.md**

+ Each member is expected to understand the entire project's requirement and have knowledge on each task.

+ Team will communicate online through Wechat and Discord. Each week, members will meet online or in-person to update progress and proceed with the remaining tasks.

+ Please write less bugs as you can.


## Team Member Names
**Step 3: Please enter your name. Each one of the team members should add the name through a different commit. For example, student A adds their name and commits, then student B adds their name and commits.**
